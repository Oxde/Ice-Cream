## üî¨ Core Mathematical Formulations

### 1. Media Mix Model Foundation
**Basic MMM Equation:**
```
Sales(t) = Base + Œ£(Medi·µ¢(t) √ó Adstock·µ¢(t) √ó Saturation·µ¢(t)) + Controls(t) + Œµ(t)
```

Where:
- `Sales(t)` = Ice cream sales at time t
- `Base` = Baseline sales (organic demand)
- `Medi·µ¢(t)` = Media spend for channel i at time t
- `Adstock·µ¢(t)` = Carryover effect for channel i
- `Saturation·µ¢(t)` = Diminishing returns effect for channel i
- `Controls(t)` = External factors (weather, seasonality, promotions)
- `Œµ(t)` = Random error term

### 2. Adstock Transformation (Carryover Effects)
**Adstock Formula:**
```
Adstock(t) = Media(t) + Œª √ó Adstock(t-1)
```

Where:
- `Œª` = Decay rate (0 ‚â§ Œª ‚â§ 1)
- Higher Œª = longer carryover effect
- Used Œª = 0.4 for baseline (moderate carryover)

**Business Logic**: TV advertising creates awareness that persists beyond spend period

### 3. Seasonality Modeling
**Cyclical Seasonality:**
```
Seasonal(t) = Œ± √ó sin(2œÄ √ó t / period) + Œ≤ √ó cos(2œÄ √ó t / period)
```

**Dutch Ice Cream Seasonality:**
```
Dutch_Season(t) = Temperature(t) √ó Holiday_Effect(t) √ó Cultural_Factor(t)
```

### 4. Ridge Regression (Regularization)
**Objective Function:**
```
minimize: ||y - XŒ≤||¬≤ + Œ±||Œ≤||¬≤
```

Where:
- First term: Prediction error (fit)
- Second term: Regularization penalty (prevent overfitting)
- Œ±: Regularization strength (selected via cross-validation)

### 5. Model Evaluation Metrics
**R¬≤ (Coefficient of Determination):**
```
R¬≤ = 1 - (SS_res / SS_tot) = 1 - (Œ£(y·µ¢ - ≈∑·µ¢)¬≤ / Œ£(y·µ¢ - »≥)¬≤)
```

**ROI Calculation:**
```
ROI = (Incremental_Sales - Media_Spend) / Media_Spend
```

**MAPE (Mean Absolute Percentage Error):**
```
MAPE = (1/n) √ó Œ£|((Actual·µ¢ - Predicted·µ¢) / Actual·µ¢)| √ó 100%
```

## üá≥üá± Dutch Market Specificity

### Cultural & Business Features Engineered:

**1. Dutch National Holidays**
- **King's Day** (April 27): Largest outdoor celebration ‚Üí ice cream peak
- **Liberation Day** (May 5): Freedom festivals ‚Üí outdoor consumption

**2. Netherlands Climate Effects**
- **Heat Waves** (>25¬∞C): Rare but massive demand drivers
- **Warm Spring** (>18¬∞C in March-May): Unexpected consumption boost
- **Indian Summer** (>20¬∞C in Sept-Oct): Extended season

**3. Dutch School Calendar**
- **Summer Holidays** (July-August): Peak family consumption
- **May Break**: Spring vacation period
- **Autumn Break**: Last outdoor activities before winter

**4. Cultural Behaviors**
- **Weekend Boost**: Dutch social patterns
- **Outdoor Season**: Temperature + cultural thresholds
- **Payday Effects**: Discretionary spending patterns

### Mathematical Implementation:
```python
# Example: Dutch Ice Cream Season Intensity
dutch_season = np.where(
    (month >= 4) & (month <= 9),  # April to September
    np.sin((month - 4) * œÄ / 5) * (temperature / 20),
    0
)
```

## üìä Model Performance Progression

| Model Stage | Test R¬≤ | Key Innovation | Business Value |
|-------------|---------|---------------|----------------|
| **04 Baseline** | 45.1% | Simple adstock, temporal validation | Reliable foundation |
| **05 Enhanced** | ~47% | Channel-specific parameters | Advanced techniques |
| **06 Dutch** | **52.6%** | Netherlands market relevance | ‚≠ê Maximum stakeholder value |

### Performance Improvement Formula:
```
Relative_Improvement = (New_R¬≤ - Baseline_R¬≤) / Baseline_R¬≤ √ó 100%
Dutch_Model_Improvement = (52.6% - 45.1%) / 45.1% √ó 100% = +16.6%
```

## üéØ Key Research Discoveries

### 1. **Weather is Primary Driver**
- Temperature correlation with sales: œÅ = 0.73
- Heat waves (>25¬∞C) create 3x normal demand
- Sunshine duration secondary but significant

### 2. **Dutch Cultural Effects are Measurable**
- King's Day shows clear sales spike in historical data
- School holidays align with consumption patterns
- Weekend effects stronger than weekday patterns

### 3. **Media Channel Hierarchy**
```
ROI Ranking (Dutch Model):
1. Search: High efficiency, immediate conversion
2. Social: Good targeting, moderate efficiency  
3. Radio National: Broad reach, positive ROI
4. TV Branding: Awareness driver, long-term effect
5. OOH: Local visibility, moderate impact
6. Radio Local: Targeted reach, positive ROI
7. TV Promo: Promotional support, campaign-dependent
```

### 4. **Seasonality Patterns**
- Primary season: May-September (temperature driven)
- Secondary peaks: Holiday weekends regardless of season
- Cultural amplifiers: Dutch holidays √ó good weather = optimal timing

2. **No Data Leakage**: Features only use past information
3. **Cross-Validation**: Time series CV for hyperparameter tuning
4. **Regularization**: Ridge regression prevents overfitting
5. **Business Logic**: All features interpretable by stakeholders

### Statistical Tests Performed:
- **Stationarity**: Augmented Dickey-Fuller tests
