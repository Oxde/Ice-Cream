# 🚀 MMM Development: Next Steps Roadmap

## 📊 **Current Status: Where We Are**
- ✅ **04 Simple MMM**: 45.1% Test R² (working foundation)
- ✅ **05 Enhanced MMM**: 46.7% Test R² (channel-specific adstock + interactions) **← CURRENT BEST**
- ❌ **06 Saturation Curves**: 51.7% Test R² (moved to hypothesis - didn't improve vs 05)

---

## 🎯 **Priority Ranking: What to Test Next**

### **🥇 Priority 1: Advanced Seasonality & Holidays** 
**Expected Impact**: +5-12% R²  
**Why**: Ice cream has complex seasonal patterns beyond basic sin/cos, and holidays have major impact

**Implementation**:
- Memorial Day, 4th of July, Labor Day specific effects
- School calendar impacts (summer break = peak season)
- Week-of-month effects (payday cycles)
- Regional seasonal differences
- Weather-season interactions (unexpected warm spring days)

---

### **🥈 Priority 2: Channel Interactions & Synergies** 
**Expected Impact**: +3-8% R²  
**Why**: Media channels often amplify each other, especially for ice cream impulse purchases

**Implementation**:
- TV Branding + TV Promo synergy (brand awareness → promo effectiveness)
- Radio National + Radio Local amplification
- Search + Social digital ecosystem effects
- OOH + TV awareness multiplier effects
- Weather-triggered media effectiveness (hot days boost all channels)

---

### **🥉 Priority 3: Promotion & External Factors**
**Expected Impact**: +2-6% R²  
**Why**: Ice cream promotions drive major sales spikes, competitor effects matter

**Implementation**:
- Promotion type effectiveness analysis
- Promotion × Channel interactions
- Competitive pressure estimation
- Distribution/availability factors
- Price elasticity modeling

---

## 🔬 **Experimental Ideas (Lower Priority)**

### **4️⃣ Non-Linear Channel Effects**
- Threshold effects (minimum spend to activate)
- Saturation points (different approach than 06)
- Diminishing returns modeling

### **5️⃣ Base vs Incremental Decomposition**
- Separate organic sales from media-driven sales
- Better understand true media incrementality
- Improve ROI calculations

### **6️⃣ Advanced Modeling Techniques**
- Bayesian MMM (uncertainty quantification)
- Prophet for trend/seasonality
- Machine learning ensemble methods

---

## 🎯 **Immediate Action Plan**

### **Next 2 Weeks: Advanced Seasonality**
```python
# File: 06_advanced_seasonality.py
- Holiday-specific effects (Memorial Day, July 4th)
- School calendar impact modeling
- Week-of-month patterns
- Regional seasonal variations
- Weather-season interaction terms
```

### **Week 3-4: Channel Synergies**
```python
# File: 07_channel_interactions.py
- TV Branding × TV Promo synergy
- Radio amplification effects
- Digital ecosystem modeling
- Weather × Media effectiveness
```

### **Week 5-6: Promotion Enhancement**
```python
# File: 08_promotion_external.py
- Promotion type effectiveness
- Competitive pressure modeling
- External factor integration
```

## 💡 **Why This Order?**

1. **Seasonality** = Biggest opportunity for ice cream (complex seasonal business)
2. **Channel Synergies** = Optimize current media mix effectiveness
3. **Promotions** = Capture major sales drivers we're missing

## 🎯 **Success Metrics**
- **Target**: 65%+ Test R² (strong MMM performance)
- **Current**: 46.7% Test R² 
- **Gap**: 18.3% to close through systematic improvements

---

## 🛠️ **Technical Approach**

### **Testing Framework**:
1. **Build on 05 Enhanced**: Start with our best model
2. **Incremental Testing**: Add one enhancement at a time
3. **Validate Thoroughly**: Always compare Test R² vs current best
4. **Business Focus**: Each improvement must provide actionable insights

### **Model Development**:
- Keep using train/test temporal split
- Feature selection to prevent overfitting  
- Ridge regression for stability
- Always visualize actual vs predicted
- Document business insights

---

## 🚨 **Key Business Insights to Address**

From our 05 Enhanced model analysis:

### **⚠️ Channel Performance Issues:**
- **TV Branding**: High spend ($5,430/week) but **Negative ROI**
- **Social & OOH**: Low impact, negative ROI
- **Need Investigation**: Why are these channels underperforming?

### **✅ High-Performing Channels:**
- **TV Promo**: High impact, positive ROI
- **Radio Local**: Medium impact, positive ROI  
- **Search**: Consistent positive ROI

### **🎯 Next Model Should Address:**
1. **Why TV Branding shows negative ROI** (timing? attribution? interaction effects?)
2. **Seasonal amplification** (when do channels work best?)
3. **Channel synergy effects** (does TV Branding enable TV Promo?)

## 🚀 **Ultimate Goal**

Build a **production-ready MMM** that:
- ✅ Accurately predicts sales (65%+ R²)
- ✅ Provides actionable ROI insights
- ✅ Guides budget allocation decisions  
- ✅ Explains channel performance patterns
- ✅ Updates easily with new data
- ✅ Stakeholders trust and use regularly
