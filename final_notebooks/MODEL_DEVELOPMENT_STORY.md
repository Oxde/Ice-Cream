# 📊 MODEL DEVELOPMENT STORY

## 🎯 Final Development Progression

The MMM project followed a systematic development approach, with some experimental branches that were ultimately not included in the final story:

### **✅ Main Development Line (Final Notebooks)**

**00-03: Foundation Phase**
- `00_basic_cleaning.ipynb` - Initial data cleaning
- `01_data_preprocessing.ipynb` - Core preprocessing pipeline
- `01c_unified_with_weather.ipynb` - Weather data integration
- `02_unified_data_eda.ipynb` - Comprehensive exploratory analysis
- `03_eda_informed_feature_optimization.ipynb` - Feature engineering

**04-05: Model Development Phase**
- `04_simple_model.ipynb` - Baseline MMM with basic features
- `05_enhanced_respectful_model.ipynb` - Technical improvements (adstock, interactions)

**11: Final Validation Phase**
- `FINAL_MODEL.ipynb` - Production-ready model with proper methodology
- `11_final_validation_model.py` - Complete validation and business analysis

### **🔬 Experimental Work (Hypothesis Folder)**

**Models 06-07: Moved to `notebooks/hypothesis/`**
- `06_dutch_seasonality_comprehensive.ipynb` - Dutch market specialization attempt
- `07_mmm_business_insights_final_report.ipynb` - Business insights exploration

**Why These Were Moved:**
1. **Methodological Issues**: Used coefficient-based ROI instead of proper counterfactual analysis
2. **Unrealistic Results**: Model 07 showed €122 return per €1 spent (impossible)
3. **Learning Value**: Still valuable for understanding what doesn't work in MMM

## 🏆 Final Model Selection

**Model 11 (FINAL_MODEL.ipynb)** was selected because:

✅ **Correct Methodology**: Proper counterfactual ROI calculations  
✅ **Business Validation**: Results pass reality checks  
✅ **Strong Performance**: 65.3% R², 7.4% MAPE  
✅ **Actionable Insights**: Clear recommendations for optimization  

## 📈 Key Business Findings

The final model reveals:

**🔴 TV Oversaturation**: -112% ROI from 61% budget share  
**🟢 Digital Opportunity**: +200% ROI from only 4.5% budget share  
**💰 Reallocation Potential**: €400-500K annual savings opportunity  

## 🎯 Implementation Ready

The final model provides:
- Reliable channel ROI rankings
- Specific reallocation recommendations  
- Mathematical validation of findings
- Implementation roadmap
