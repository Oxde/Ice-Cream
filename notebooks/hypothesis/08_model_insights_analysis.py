# # Enhanced Model Insights & Analysis
# 
# **What Happened**: Our theory-based enhanced model DECREASED performance
# - Test R² dropped from 45.1% → 37.2% (-17.4%)
# - Overfitting gap increased from 14.1% → 25.8% (+82.8%)
# 
# **Key Question**: Why did adding lag effects and adstock make things worse?
# 
# **Investigation Focus**:
# 1. Understand the performance degradation
# 2. Identify which enhancements helped vs hurt
# 3. Extract actionable insights for next iteration
