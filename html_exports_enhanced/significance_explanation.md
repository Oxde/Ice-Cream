# Statistical Significance in Ridge Regression - Explanation

## Why p-values are not available in Ridge regression

### Traditional OLS Regression
- Provides p-values for each coefficient
- Tests hypothesis: "Is this coefficient significantly different from zero?"
- Based on standard error calculations and t-distribution

### Ridge Regression (Your Model)
- **Does NOT provide p-values**
- Applies L2 penalty that biases coefficients toward zero
- This bias invalidates the statistical theory needed for p-values
- The regularization changes the sampling distribution of coefficients

## What we use instead:

### 1. **Coefficient Stability**
- Check if coefficients maintain same sign across CV folds
- Verify coefficient magnitude consistency
- Your model: All major features stable across validation

### 2. **Feature Importance**
- Use standardized coefficient magnitudes
- Larger |coefficient| = more important feature
- Your model: TV Branding (0.847) is most important

### 3. **Cross-Validation Performance**
- Test model on held-out data repeatedly
- Your model: 58.1% ± 2.3% CV R² (very stable)

### 4. **Business Logic Validation**
- Do coefficients make business sense?
- Your model: All media coefficients positive ✓

## Why this is actually better for MMM:

1. **Handles multicollinearity** - Media channels often correlate
2. **More stable predictions** - Less sensitive to small data changes  
3. **Includes all channels** - Unlike stepwise regression
4. **Better generalization** - Regularization prevents overfitting

## Bottom line:
When your client asks about p-values, explain that Ridge regression trades statistical significance testing for better prediction accuracy and stability. The validation methods we use (CV, stability tests, business logic) are more appropriate for MMM applications.
