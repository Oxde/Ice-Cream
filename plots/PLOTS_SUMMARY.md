## ðŸŽ¯ How to Use These Plots in Your Report

### For Executive Presentations:
1. **Start with Section 6** - Show current budget allocation inefficiencies
2. **Move to Section 7** - Demonstrate ROI disparities between channels
3. **Present Section 8** - Show optimization scenarios and recommendations
4. **Reference Section 5** - Validate model reliability (if technical audience)

### For Technical Documentation:
1. **Section 5** - Model validation and performance metrics
2. **Section 6** - Data overview and baseline analysis
3. **Section 7** - Methodology and ROI calculations
4. **Section 8** - Simulation framework and results

### For Business Stakeholders:
- **Primary:** Section 8 (scenarios and recommendations)
- **Supporting:** Section 7 (ROI analysis)
- **Context:** Section 6 (current allocation)

## ðŸ“‹ File Naming Convention

Each plot follows the naming pattern:
`section_XX_[description]_[focus].png`

Where:
- `XX` = Section number (05, 06, 07, 08)
- `[description]` = Main content type
- `[focus]` = Specific analysis focus

This ensures plots are easily organized and positioned in the correct report sections.
