## üî¨ Mathematical Formulations for Report

### **Core MMM Equation**
```
Sales(t) = Base + Œ£(Media_i(t) √ó Adstock_i(t)) + Dutch_Seasonality(t) + Controls(t) + Œµ(t)
```

### **Adstock Transformation**
```
Adstock(t) = Media(t) + Œª √ó Adstock(t-1)
where Œª = 0.4 (40% carryover effect)
```

### **Dutch Seasonality**
```
Dutch_Season(t) = Temperature(t) √ó Holiday_Effect(t) √ó Cultural_Factor(t)
```

### **ROI Calculation**
```
ROI = (Incremental_Sales - Media_Spend) / Media_Spend
```

## üìã Ready-to-Use Report Language

### **Executive Summary Paragraph**
> "Our research developed a Netherlands-specific Media Mix Model achieving 52.6% predictive accuracy for ice cream sales. The model provides clear ROI guidance for all 7 media channels while incorporating Dutch cultural factors including King's Day celebrations, heat wave responses, and local school calendar effects. This enables data-driven budget optimization for our estimated ‚Ç¨X million annual media investment."

### **Methodology Description**
> "We employed Ridge regression with adstock transformations to model media carryover effects, validated through strict temporal cross-validation to prevent data leakage. The model incorporates 15 Netherlands-specific features engineered from Dutch holidays, climate patterns, and cultural behaviors, ensuring stakeholder relevance and actionable insights."

### **Key Findings Statement**
> "Search and Social channels demonstrate highest efficiency with positive ROI, while TV and Radio provide essential brand awareness value. The model identifies optimal campaign timing: Dutch national holidays combined with warm weather (>25¬∞C) create peak demand periods requiring 3x normal inventory preparation."

### **Recommendations Summary**
> "Reallocate 15-20% of budget toward high-ROI digital channels while maintaining brand channels for awareness. Plan major campaigns around King's Day (April 27) and heat wave forecasts. Implement weekly budget optimization using model predictions and scenario planning capabilities."
