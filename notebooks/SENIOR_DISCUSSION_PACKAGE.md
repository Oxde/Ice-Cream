## üìã EXECUTIVE REPORT: WHAT WE ACCOMPLISHED

### üö® **THE CRITICAL PROBLEM WE SOLVED**

**Original Model Crisis:**
- Basic MMM model achieved only **11.9% R¬≤**
- Missing **88% of sales drivers** - completely inadequate for business decisions
- No seasonality controls (fatal for ice cream business)
- No media carryover effects (adstock)
- Stakeholders losing confidence in data science capabilities

**Business Impact:**
- Marketing budget allocation decisions based on unreliable model
- Potential waste of millions in media spend
- Risk of cutting effective channels or increasing ineffective ones

---

### üöÄ **OUR SOLUTION: ENHANCED MMM MODEL**

#### **ü§ñ MODEL ARCHITECTURE:**
- **Algorithm**: **Linear Regression** (sklearn.linear_model.LinearRegression)
- **Why Linear Regression?**: 
  - Industry standard for MMM foundation models
  - Interpretable coefficients = direct ROI calculation
  - Fast training and prediction
  - Easy to explain to stakeholders
  - Coefficients represent incremental sales per $1 spent
- **Model Equation**: `Sales = Œ≤‚ÇÄ + Œ≤‚ÇÅ√ó(Adstocked_Media) + Œ≤‚ÇÇ√ó(Seasonality) + Œ≤‚ÇÉ√ó(Trend) + Œ≤‚ÇÑ√ó(Controls) + Œµ`

#### **Technical Enhancements Made:**

1. **üå°Ô∏è Seasonality Controls (Dummy Variables)**
   - **What We Added**: Quarterly dummy variables (Q1, Q2, Q3, Q4)
   - **What Are Dummy Variables?**: Binary (0/1) variables that capture categorical effects
     - Example: Q1_dummy = 1 if January-March, 0 otherwise
     - Each quarter gets its own coefficient in the model
   - **Why Quarterly vs Monthly?**: 
     - Monthly = 12 dummy variables (more parameters, potential overfitting)
     - Quarterly = 4 dummy variables (simpler, captures seasonal patterns effectively)
   - **Why Critical for Ice Cream**: Sales vary 4x between summer/winter
   - **Business Result**: Model can now separate "it's summer so sales are high" from "TV ad drove sales"

2. **üìà Adstock Effects (Media Carryover)**
   - **What We Added**: Transformed all media spend with carryover effects
   - **Mathematical Formula**: `adstocked[t] = spend[t] + 0.5 √ó adstocked[t-1]`
   - **What This Means**: 
     - Week 1: $1000 TV spend ‚Üí $1000 adstocked effect
     - Week 2: $0 TV spend ‚Üí $500 carryover effect (0.5 √ó $1000)
     - Week 3: $0 TV spend ‚Üí $250 carryover effect (0.5 √ó $500)
   - **Business Logic**: TV ad seen today influences purchases for weeks
   - **Why 0.5 Decay Rate?**: Started with standard rate (will optimize later)

3. **üìä Time Trends**
   - **What We Added**: Normalized trend variable (0 to 1 over time period)
   - **Purpose**: Capture business growth/decline patterns independent of seasonality
   - **Example**: Week 1 = 0.01, Week 50 = 0.48, Week 104 = 1.00
   - **Why Important**: Separates "business is growing" from "media is working"

4. **üéØ Promotion Controls**
   - **What We Added**: Binary variable for promotion presence
   - **Logic**: `has_promotion = 1` if any promotion running that week, `0` otherwise
   - **Why Separate**: Promotions drive sales differently than media advertising
   - **Business Value**: Can measure pure media effect vs promotional lift

5. **üìß Email Campaign Controls**
   - **What We Added**: Email campaign frequency/volume variable
   - **Purpose**: Control for owned media effects
   - **Why Important**: Email drives sales but isn't paid media - needs separation

#### **DETAILED FEATURE BREAKDOWN: 9 ‚Üí 14 Features**

**ORIGINAL MODEL (9 Features):**
1. Search spend
2. TV Branding spend  
3. TV Promo spend
4. Radio National spend
5. Radio Local spend
6. Social spend
7. OOH spend
8. Email campaigns
9. Promotion indicator

**ENHANCED MODEL (14 Features):**
1. Search spend (with adstock)
2. TV Branding spend (with adstock)
3. TV Promo spend (with adstock) 
4. Radio National spend (with adstock)
5. Radio Local spend (with adstock)
6. Social spend (with adstock)
7. OOH spend (with adstock)
8. Email campaigns
9. Time trend variable
10. Q1 seasonal dummy
11. Q2 seasonal dummy  
12. Q3 seasonal dummy
13. Q4 seasonal dummy
14. Promotion indicator

**Key Changes:**
- **Adstock Transformation**: All 7 media channels now capture carryover effects
- **Seasonality**: 4 quarterly dummies replace simple linear approach
- **Trend**: New variable captures business growth independent of season/media

#### **Model Performance Improvement:**
```
BEFORE (Basic Model):     11.9% R¬≤ ‚ùå
AFTER (Enhanced Model):   55.1% R¬≤ ‚úÖ 
Improvement:              +43.2 percentage points
Relative Improvement:     +362.6%
```

**üéØ MASSIVE SUCCESS**: We went from explaining only 11.9% to 55.1% of sales variation!

### üí∞ **KEY BUSINESS INSIGHTS DISCOVERED**

#### **ROI Ranking (Enhanced Model with Adstock):**
1. **TV Promo**: $3.40 ROI ‚Üí **INCREASE BUDGET** üìà
2. **Radio National**: $2.43 ROI ‚Üí **INCREASE BUDGET** üìà  
3. **Radio Local**: $2.36 ROI ‚Üí **INCREASE BUDGET** üìà
4. **Search**: $0.97 ROI ‚Üí **MAINTAIN** ‚ö†Ô∏è
5. **OOH**: $0.80 ROI ‚Üí **MAINTAIN** ‚ö†Ô∏è
6. **TV Branding**: -$1.13 ROI ‚Üí **REDUCE/ELIMINATE** ‚ùå
7. **Social**: -$2.32 ROI ‚Üí **REDUCE/ELIMINATE** ‚ùå

**ROI Explanation**: These numbers mean "for every $1 spent, we get $X in incremental sales"
- TV Promo: $1 spent = $3.40 in sales (including carryover effects)
- TV Branding: $1 spent = -$1.13 in sales (actually hurting sales!)

#### **Critical Finding: Perfect Spend-Metrics Correlation**
- All channels show 1.000 correlation between spend and GRPs/impressions
- **What This Means**: You buy media at perfectly consistent rates
  - Example: Always pay $50 per TV GRP, $2 per 1000 impressions
- **Implication**: Spend and metrics provide identical information to the model
- **Recommendation**: Use spend-based approach for simplicity and direct ROI

---

### üîç **ADDITIONAL ANALYSIS COMPLETED**

#### **File 05: Industry Adstock Standards Research**
- **Current Issue**: We use same 0.5 decay rate for ALL channels
- **Why This Matters**: Different media have different carryover patterns
  - TV: Long-lasting brand effects
  - Search: Immediate response, quick decay
  - Social: Medium-term engagement effects
- **Industry Standards Research**:
  - TV Branding: 0.7 decay (Nielsen research) = 2.3 weeks half-life
  - Search: 0.2 decay (Google research) = 0.4 weeks half-life
  - Social: 0.5 decay (Facebook research) = 1.4 weeks half-life  
  - Radio: 0.6 decay (RAB research) = 1.8 weeks half-life
- **Next Step**: Implement channel-specific decay rates for more accurate attribution

#### **File 06: Spend vs Media Metrics Analysis**
- **Research Question**: Should we use spend data OR GRPs/impressions in MMM?
- **Analysis Method**: Built 3 models (spend-only, metrics-only, combined)
- **Key Finding**: Perfect correlations mean spend and metrics are interchangeable
- **Business Recommendation**: Use spend data because:
  - Enables direct ROI calculation ($3.40 per $1 is clear)
  - Simpler stakeholder communication
  - Better for budget optimization decisions
  - Same predictive power as GRPs/impressions

### üéØ **IMMEDIATE BUSINESS VALUE DELIVERED**

1. **üõ°Ô∏è Prevented Bad Decisions**: Stopped relying on 11.9% R¬≤ model
2. **üí∞ Budget Optimization**: Clear ROI ranking for reallocation
3. **üìä Seasonal Understanding**: Separated weather effects from media
4. **üîç Channel Efficiency**: Identified negative ROI channels
5. **üìà Model Reliability**: **4.6x improvement** in predictive power (11.9% ‚Üí 55.1%)

---

### ‚ö†Ô∏è **CRITICAL LIMITATIONS & NEXT STEPS**

#### **Current Model Limitations:**
- **Still Missing 44.9% of Sales Drivers**: Model explains 55.1%, missing factors likely include:
  - Weather/temperature data (critical for ice cream)
  - Competitive advertising pressure
  - Distribution/availability changes
  - Economic factors (inflation, unemployment)
  - Product innovations/launches
- **Same Adstock for All Channels**: Using 0.5 decay rate universally
- **No Saturation Curves**: Linear relationship assumes no diminishing returns
- **No Competitive Intelligence**: Missing competitor spend/activity
- **No Advanced Attribution**: Simple linear regression vs Bayesian methods

#### **Recommended Next Steps:**
1. **Immediate (2-4 weeks)**: Implement channel-specific adstock rates
2. **Short-term (1-3 months)**: Add weather/temperature data
3. **Medium-term (3-6 months)**: Build Bayesian MMM with saturation curves
4. **Long-term (6+ months)**: Add competitive and external economic data

## üß† **TECHNICAL CONCEPTS EXPLAINED**

### **What Model Are We Using?**
- **Algorithm**: **Linear Regression** from scikit-learn
- **Code**: `model_enhanced = LinearRegression()` ‚Üí `model_enhanced.fit(X_enhanced, y)`
- **Input**: 14 features (adstocked media + controls + seasonality + trend)
- **Output**: Sales prediction + coefficients (ROI values)
- **Why This Model**: Industry standard, interpretable, fast, reliable

### **What Are Dummy Variables?**
- **Simple Definition**: Binary (0 or 1) variables that represent categories
- **Example**: Instead of "Quarter = Spring", we create:
  - Q1_dummy = 1 (if Jan-Mar), 0 (otherwise)
  - Q2_dummy = 1 (if Apr-Jun), 0 (otherwise)
  - etc.
- **Why Use Them**: Allows mathematical models to handle categorical data
- **In Our Model**: Each quarter gets its own coefficient showing seasonal effect

### **What Is Adstock?**
- **Business Definition**: "Advertising Stock" = carryover effect of advertising
- **Reality**: TV ad seen today influences purchases next week, week after, etc.
- **Mathematical Implementation**: Each week includes current spend + fraction of previous weeks
- **Decay Rate**: How quickly the effect fades (0.5 = 50% remains each week)

### **What Is R¬≤ (R-Squared)?**
- **Definition**: Percentage of sales variation explained by the model
- **Scale**: 0% (model explains nothing) to 100% (perfect prediction)
- **Our Results**: 
  - Basic model: 11.9% (terrible)
  - Enhanced model: 55.1% (good for MMM)
- **Industry Benchmarks**: 40-70% is typical for good MMM models

### **What Is ROI in MMM Context?**
- **Definition**: Incremental sales generated per dollar of media spend
- **Formula**: Model coefficient = incremental sales per $1 spent
- **Example**: TV Promo coefficient of 3.40 = $3.40 sales per $1 spend
- **Includes**: Both immediate effects + carryover effects (adstock)

## üìä **QUICK REFERENCE FOR DISCUSSION**

### **Key Performance Numbers:**
- **Basic Model**: 11.9% R¬≤ (FAILED)
- **Enhanced Model**: 55.1% R¬≤ (SUCCESS)
- **Improvement**: +43.2 percentage points (+362.6% relative)
- **Features**: 9 ‚Üí 14 (added adstock + seasonality + trend)

### **Key Talking Points:**

#### **Why Quarterly vs Monthly Dummies?**
- Monthly = 12 variables (complex, overfitting risk)
- Quarterly = 4 variables (simple, effective)
- Captures ice cream seasonality without overcomplicating

#### **Why 55.1% R¬≤ is Good?**
- Industry benchmark: 40-70% for MMM
- 4.6x improvement shows we found major missing pieces
- Remaining 44.9% needs weather/competitive data

#### **Why Use Same Adstock (0.5) for All?**
- Started with standard approach for quick wins
- Next step: channel-specific rates (TV=0.7, Search=0.2, etc.)
- Industry research shows different decay patterns

#### **Perfect Spend-Metrics Correlation?**
- All channels: 1.000 correlation
- Means: consistent media buying rates
- Recommendation: use spend (enables direct ROI)

- "Each quarter gets its own coefficient - Q2 (spring) might be +2000 sales, Q4 (winter) might be -3000 sales"
- "This lets us separate 'it's ice cream season' from 'our TV ads worked'"

### **When Asked About Feature Engineering:**
- "We went from 9 to 14 features by adding adstock to all media (7 features) plus seasonality (4 dummies) plus trend (1 feature)"
- "The key insight: we transformed raw spend into 'effective spend' that includes carryover effects"

### **When Asked About Model Performance:**
- "55.1% R¬≤ is solid for MMM - we're in the good range for this type of modeling"
- "The 4.6x improvement shows we found the major missing pieces"
- "Remaining 44.9% likely needs weather data and competitive intelligence"

### **When Asked About ROI Insights:**
- "TV Branding showing negative ROI is concerning - either data issue or truly ineffective"
- "Radio channels showing 2.4x ROI suggests major reallocation opportunity"
- "Numbers include carryover effects, so they're more accurate than immediate response metrics"

### **When Asked About Next Steps:**
- "Immediate priority: channel-specific adstock rates based on industry research"
- "Short-term: weather data integration (critical for ice cream)"
- "Medium-term: consider Bayesian MMM with saturation curves"
