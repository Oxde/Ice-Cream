## 🚨 **3. DATA PREPROCESSING SECTION - ADD DUTCH SPECIALIZATION**

### **Missing Netherlands-Specific Processing:**

**ORIGINAL TEXT (Lines 60-70):**
```
"Feature Engineering
To prepare the data for modeling, several new variables were engineered:
- Time-based features: Week number, quarter, and holiday flags were derived from the date.
- Weather adjustments: Weekly average temperature, total rainfall, and wind index were 
  introduced to capture external demand effects.
- Promotion and media indicators: A combined flag for promotional weeks and another for 
  email outreach were added to isolate campaign impact.
- Spend consistency: Weeks where total spend across major channels was zero were excluded, 
  as they likely reflected media inactivity or reporting gaps."
```

**🚫 WHY THIS IS INCOMPLETE:**
- **Missing Dutch Features**: No mention of Netherlands-specific cultural features
- **Generic Weather**: Doesn't explain Dutch weather intelligence
- **Missing Advanced Features**: No mention of heat wave detection, Dutch holidays

**✅ SUGGESTED REPLACEMENT:**

```
"Statistical Performance
The model demonstrated a solid fit with the data, explaining a significant portion of 
the variation in weekly sales.
- R-squared (R²): Approximately 0.76, indicating a strong explanatory power for 
  real-world marketing data."
```

**🚫 WHY THIS IS WRONG:**
- **Impossible R² Value**: 0.76 (76%) is unrealistically high for MMM
- **Missing Evaluation Methodology**: No explanation of how we evaluated the model
- **Missing Data Split Information**: No mention of train/test split strategy

**✅ SUGGESTED REPLACEMENT:**
```
"Model Evaluation Methodology
