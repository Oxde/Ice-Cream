# 📋 SUMMARY OF CHANGES ADDRESSING SENIOR FEEDBACK

## 🎯 **Senior Feedback Addressed**

### **Original Feedback:**
> "This section needs to be way more elaborate. Like how did you exactly do the simulation, and how did you get to these numbers? Also, if I recall correctly, Digital was split up between different channels such as display, social and search. Do not treat them as one channel"

---

## ✅ **CHANGES MADE**

### **1. DIGITAL CHANNEL SEPARATION**

**BEFORE (Incorrect):**
- Treated "Digital" as one aggregated channel
- General recommendations for "digital channels"
- Combined ROI reporting

**AFTER (Corrected):**
- **Search Marketing:** €622/week, 156% ROI, Power 0.5 saturation
- **Social Media:** €608/week, 134% ROI, Linear transformation
- Separate scaling recommendations for each
- Individual optimization parameters documented

**Files Updated:**
- `02_moderate_changes.md` - Added Search ↔ Social correlation (0.156)
- `04_urgent_section7_roi_analysis.md` - Separated channel table and insights
- `05_urgent_section8_recommendations.md` - Channel-specific recommendations

### **2. DETAILED SIMULATION METHODOLOGY**

**BEFORE (Missing):**
- No explanation of how scenario numbers were calculated
- No step-by-step methodology
- No mathematical formulation

**AFTER (Comprehensive):**
- **New file:** `06_detailed_simulation_methodology.md`
- Step-by-step calculation process with actual numbers
- Mathematical formulas for each transformation
- Validation methodology and constraints
- Example calculations for each scenario

**Key Additions:**
```python
# Example simulation calculation
search_increment = β_search * (search_sat_scenario - search_sat_baseline)
search_increment = 0.623 * (1.115 - 0.789) = 0.203
```

### **3. COMPLETE MODEL FORMULA SPECIFICATION**

**BEFORE (Missing):**
- No mathematical model specification
- Vague transformation descriptions

**AFTER (Complete):**
- Full mathematical formula in Section 5:
$$Sales(t) = \alpha + \sum_{i=1}^{7} \beta_i \cdot S_i(X_{adstock,i}(t)) + \sum_{j=1}^{m} \gamma_j \cdot Z_j(t) + \epsilon(t)$$

- Channel-specific transformation functions:
  - S₃(Search) = (Adstock₀.₁₂₃(Search)/1000)^0.5
  - S₄(Social) = Social_Media/1000
- Individual optimization parameters documented

### **4. ENHANCED SCENARIO SPECIFICITY**

**BEFORE (Vague):**
- "10% shift from TV to Digital"
- "Efficiency-driven reallocation"

**AFTER (Specific):**
- **Conservative:** Search +100% (€622→€1,244), Social +50% (€608→€912)
- **Aggressive:** Search +200% (€622→€1,866), Social +100% (€608→€1,216)
- **Maximum:** Search +300% (€622→€2,488), Social +150% (€608→€1,520)

## 🔍 **WHAT WE DISCOVERED FROM OUR CURRENT MODEL**

### **Digital Channel Analysis:**
Our FINAL_MODEL2.py actually shows we have:
- **search_cost** - Separate Search Marketing channel
- **social_cost** - Separate Social Media channel
- **Low correlation (0.156)** - Confirming they should be optimized individually

### **No Display Channel Found:**
- Senior mentioned "display, social and search"
- Our dataset only contains Search and Social
- **Recommendation:** If Display data exists, it should be added as separate channel

### **Transformation Differences:**
- **Search:** Requires Power 0.5 saturation (moderate diminishing returns)
- **Social:** Uses Linear transformation (minimal saturation at current levels)
- **This justifies different scaling strategies**

## 🚀 **ADDITIONAL SIMULATIONS RECOMMENDED**

Based on our corrected methodology, we should consider:

### **Priority 1 (Immediate):**
1. **Search Saturation Testing:** Test 100%, 200%, 300% increases to find exact saturation point
2. **Social Platform Split:** If we have Facebook vs Instagram data, optimize separately
3. **TV Creative Efficiency:** Simulate improved TV performance through creative refresh

### **Priority 2 (Next Phase):**
4. **Weather-Responsive Allocation:** Dynamic digital scaling during temperature spikes >25°C
5. **Cultural Calendar Optimization:** King's Day, Liberation Day specific scenarios
6. **Competitive Response Modeling:** How performance changes if competitors react

### **Priority 3 (Advanced):**
7. **Multi-Touch Attribution:** Account for Search + Social synergies
8. **Real-Time Optimization:** Automated budget triggers based on performance
9. **Risk Analysis:** Portfolio diversification vs. concentration trade-offs

## 📊 **UPDATED CORRECTED NUMBERS**

### **Individual Channel Performance:**
| Channel | Weekly Spend | ROI | Saturation Type | Scaling Potential |
|---------|-------------|-----|-----------------|-------------------|
| **Search Marketing** | €622 | +156% | Power 0.5 | 2-3x |
| **Social Media** | €608 | +134% | Linear | 3-4x |
| **Radio Local** | €1,863 | +203% | Square Root | 1.5x |
| **TV Branding** | €5,491 | -23% | Power 0.3 | Reduce 30% |
| **TV Promo** | €3,123 | -41% | Power 0.3 | Reduce 20% |
| **Radio National** | €1,469 | -744% | Power 0.7 | Eliminate |
| **OOH** | €793 | -89% | Power 0.3 | Reduce 50% |

### **Corrected Portfolio Insights:**
- **Digital underinvestment:** 8.9% budget, 145%+ average ROI
- **Individual optimization:** Each digital channel needs different scaling strategy
- **Combined potential:** €1.5M+ annual improvement through channel-specific reallocation
